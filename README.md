# Simple HTTP Server

This repository contains the code for a simple HTTP server which serves static files from a directory. This server should NOT be used in production as it has not been tested. I built this as an exercise to learn Go.

## Setup

To try the server locally, run the following commands:

1. `git clone git@github.com:mattrrubino/simple-http.git`
2. `cd simple-http`
3. `go build -o http`

Then, run the executable from the directory you would like to serve. The server runs on port 8080.
